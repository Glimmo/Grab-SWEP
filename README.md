A simple SWEP I made because I was sick to death of big ugly gravity guns going WAAWAWAWWAWAW BZZZT UUUN over and over again when moving around Money Printers or similar.

This addon simply makes it so that you can Left Click on an entity you wish to pickup and you will pick it up using the same mechanics as if you pickup a light prop. It works even better then gravity guns because you can actually observe where the props go while they move.

ALL PROPS AND ENTITIES BY DEFAULT ARE PICKUPABLE! Including vehicles. You must add any entities you do not wish players to pickup using the grab_addblacklist (entity) console command in your servers console. You can also remove blacklisted entities with the grab_removeblacklist (entity) command. Ingame, everytime you pickup an object a notification will appear in your clientside console detailing the entity class of what you just picked up. Use what you see in their as the entity to blacklist.
